	\section{Bio}
	\setlength{\parindent}{1em}
	My passion lies in combining and applying multiple disciplines in order to tackle complex and diverse technical challenges. Over the last 15 years, I have used a mix of research and software engineering application to foster innovation for ultrasound imaging and medical image processing. 

	Most recently, I took time to create my own path by founding mofii io in order to scratch the creative itch I've had for years to develop and refine lingering ideas into possible products. 


	Before mofii io, I served as the Head of Software \& Algorithms at the start-up Orchard Ultrasound Innovations. My role was to define and develop the critical path to the company's software and algorithms foundation and to lead novel applied physics data-processing research which was built upon my role as a Research Scientist at Stanford University.

	I like to think of myself as collaborative and adaptable. My energy comes from being able to solve what is most needed - whether it is to focus on a specific technical challenge, to build a bridge for effective communication between software and hardware engineers, or to be a champion to ensure that business operations have the context they need to build an enduring business.
